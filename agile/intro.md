# Agile Methodology

## Drawbacks of Waterfall
- Each phase ends with a well defined deliverables for the next phase
- Product won't be seen by customer until 1/3 phase of product
- Processes over people


## Agile Approach
> Iterative and Incremental
Agile works with small iteration of software development lifecycle

### The Agile Manifesto
1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

### Agile Principles
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
   - Delivering software early and continuously
   - the measure of success is software that provides some business value. In a typical Agile project, a backlog of customer requirements is maintained and prioritized by business value by the customer. The development team works from the top of the backlog to the bottom.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9.  Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

# Scrum
A Framework that facilitaes the development of complex products.
See link for detailed scrum doc at [Scrum Guides](https://www.scrumguides.org/)
<br>
Scrum consists of three team roles, five events and three artifacts

The __Scrum team__ builds a product iteratively and incrementally in time box periods of __30 calendar days__ or __less__. Each __sprint__ comprises one __product iteration__. Each sprint begins with an event called __Sprint Planning__, in which the development team works with the product owner to mark which items in the __product backlog__ will be built. The Scrum team then defines a __sprint goal__, concise wording of a few sentences, to layout the high-level goal of the sprint. Then the development team comes up with a plan to convert these items into a usable and shippable product. This plan, the sprint backlog, is a subset of the product backlog. It includes product backlog items selected for the sprint, plus a separate related list of tasks for the development team. The development team builds the product increment and synchronizes their work daily in an event called the Daily Scrum. The Scrum Master and Product Owner collaborate with the development team throughout the sprint. At the end of the sprint, the development team has a product increment, which is essentially the integrated and usable product built to that point. From this review, the Scrum team plans future work based on their findings. 

The Scrum team reviews the increment with a group of stakeholders in an event called the __Sprint Review__. The sprint ends with another event called __Sprint Retrospective__, which is an opportunity for the scrum team to become more efficient. In this event, every aspect of their approach, other than the product increment, is reviewed. So that's Scrum in a nutshell.


## Three Pillars of Scrum
- Transparency
- Inspection
- Adaptation


## Core Values of Scrum
- Focus
- Respect
- Openness
- Courage
- Commitment

## Roles
- Product Owner
  - Represents the business stakeholder
  - An individual / not a committee
  - anyone on scrum team may change the product backlog, but must do it with product owner's knowledge
  - Product owner is accountable for the product backlog
  - Responsible for conveying the product backlogs items clearly

- Development Team Member
  - How the items needs to be build
  - team can write code, design, test, produce documentation and do whatever is necessary to convert a set of product backlog
  - 3-9 people team
  - Team with different skills preferred than skilled individual
  - Flat hierarchy, no managers or team leads

- Scrum master
  - A scrum expert, a scrum and agile coach for the product owner and the development team.
  - helps to resolve any issues experienced by the development team or product owner.
  - The Scrum master can work with the product owner or escalate the matter to those outside the Scrum team, such as executive management, or they can just facilitate the problem-solving process so the development team resolves the problem internally.
  - The Scrum master also coaches the product owner to make sure they understand their role and how to manage the product backlog. Most organizations adopt Scrum


## Scrum Events
- Sprint
  - Time boxed to 30 calendar days or less
- Event Planning
  - Defines what the dev team works on and how they will execute the plan
- Daily Scrum
  - Daily meeting to inspect the dev team's work and adapt their work to be more efficient
- Sprint Review
  - The scrum team reviews their work and progress that occurred during the sprint
  - This event includes external stakeholders and is the time where future work is planned
- Sprint retrospective
  - The last event is the sprint retrospective. The scrum team gets together to discuss how they can be more efficient
